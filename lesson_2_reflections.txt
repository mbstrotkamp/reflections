1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository it begins tracking changes to that repository. If you don't do it, what's the point? It also creates a .git folder that remains hidden.
2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is not committed. The value is that it gives you a place to keep track of what you're doing prior to commitment.
